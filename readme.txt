== LessThan3 ==


Hi, thanks for at least opening this file.

If you're reading this, then you are one step closer to unlocking the full potential of LessThan3.


// THE COLORS \\

To get started, change the color palette of your terminal to match the ones we use to develop the game.
Here is the list of colors and hex color we used.
    BLACK   #04252e
    RED     #a31929
    GREEN   #00b159
    YELLOW  #ffc425
    BLUE    #3b5998
    MAGENTA #f799b5
    CYAN    #66cccc
    WHITE   #ffffff

If you're using dconfEditor, copy and paste this line instead.
    #04252e:#A31929:#00b159:#ffc425:#3b5998:#F799B5:#66cccc:#94a3a5:#46585D:#dc322f:#329f69:#ffca66:#268bd2:#F799B5:#7FC6C1:#ffffff

All done? Let's move on to the next step.


// THE NCURSES \\

We use an external library called ncurses.h, exclusive for linux. Sorry Windows, but you can't run this game.
Unfortunately, ncurses.h usually doesn't come installed as default for any linux distros.

Type (or copy-paste) the following command to install ncurses.h

    sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev



// THE TERMINAL \\

Due to the use of ncurses.h in this game, the size of terminal determines whether the texts will be printed on-screen.

Adjust your terminal to be at least 167 columns x 38 rows wide. 
You could do that by decreasing the font size or enlarging the terminal window.


// THE COMMANDS \\

While in-game, please refrain from spamming commands or pressing any key at all when not prompted. 
This is to avoid the issues of command stacking, where the previous commands are stored and immediately executed after
the animations or waiting time expired.

Believe me, when it's time for you to do something, you will know it.

That's all! Have fun playing the game!
